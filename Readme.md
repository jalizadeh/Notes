---------
Summary and abstraction of programming languages or courses that I`m studying. These notes are not necessarily or 100% error-proof, but only written to be saved and be accessed easier, first by me, then maybe others who may need. 


#How to use:

For enjoying reading these ".notes" files, you need **[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)** and add the package **[Sublime Notes](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Notes)**
